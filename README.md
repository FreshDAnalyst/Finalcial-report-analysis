## Introduction

The following dataset is the financial record of a business showing the sales, profit, product sold, customer record of each sales for the year 2013 and 2014 respectively. I will be analyzing this data with Excel in Microsoft 356 using the **“Analyze data”** feature for better and easier analysis and visualization.

## Excel Feartures used
•	“Analyze data” feature

•	Pivot table

## Skills Demonstrated
The following skills were incorporated.

Analyzing data with the AI fearure in Excel, Pivot table, Vlookup 

## Problem Statement
1.	How is the sale during the fourth quarter of 2013 compare to the fourth quarter of 2014
2.	What is the top most sold product in each country
3.	Which customer segment generates more profit.
4.	Which country receives the highest average discount
5.	Is the product with the highest sales also the product with the highest profit? Lets explore

## Date Sourcing

I got the data from the #30daysoflearning organized by Microsoft learn, I downloaded it from a github repository and upload it to my Microsoft 365 account for analysis and visualization.

It contains **16 columns** and **701 rows**

## Date Cleaning/Transformation

•	I converted the data type for the Product and discount columns from account datatype to general datatype

•	Generally the data is clean without blank cells and errors and all data type are correct

## Data Modelling

The data is in a single CSV sheet in a single table and does not requires any type of modelling

It helps for easier and faster analysis while it helps to save time a lot . Using the “Analyze data” tool is all about typing in the right questions using natural language in English and excel generates the answer automatically instead of me writing formulas to answer. It’s a whole new way of analyzing data.  The process will be shown below.

**1.	How is the sale during the fourth quarter of 2013 compare to the fourth quarter of 2014.**

### Solution

Using the “Analyze data” tool, I typed in the following question:    

_**(Create a line chart that compares the sales in year 2013 and 2014 by month name "September", "October", "November" and "December")**_               _check image below…_

It automatically created the pivot table and chart:
The insight says sales is higher in every month in the fourth quarter of 2014 than 2013 except for November. November 2013 has a higher sales than November 2014.
**Another question is why the changes from normal?**

**2.	What is the top most sold product in each country?**

### Solution

Using the pivot table and a bar chart.
The insight says product Paseo is the most sold product in all countries with an average of 40.4 times per country.          _Check image below…_

**3.	Which customer segment generates more profit.**

Using the **“Analyze data”** tool, I typed in the following question :   _**“Highest profit by segment”**_                         _check image below._

The insight says the _**Government**_ is the customer segment with the highest profit generated.

**4.	Which country receives the highest average discount.**

Using the pivot table and bar chart.
The insight says the _**United State**_ has the highest average discount…           _Check image below.._

**5.	Is the product with the highest sales amount also the product with the highest profit amount ? Lets explore**

### Solution

Using the pivot table:
The chart shows that the product with highest sales amount is also the product with highest profit amount. Having 85% of the whole sales amount as the cost of production and 15% as profit.         _Check image below…_
